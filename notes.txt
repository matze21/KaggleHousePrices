notes: most of the houses are 1 story 1946 & newer and low density residential areas (also in bldgType)
- street seems to have no gravel? -> useless?  vs. alley has grvl and pave (gravel alley indicates bigger ranch?)
- utilities only AllPub -> useless

!!!!all Quality features should keep order!!!!

outliers: Lot Frontage, LotArea, MasVnrArea, BsmtFinSF1, totalBsmtSF, 1stFlSF, GrLivArea, 
garageArea, woodDeckSF, OpenPorchSF


useless features because only one value (verify):
-street / 
-utilities
-condition2
- roofMatl
- bsmtFinSF2
- heating
- lowQualFinSF
- enclosedPorch, 3SsnPorch, ScreenPorch, PoolArea (use pool qual as one hot encoded)
- MiscVal


minimal impact (-> build categorical feature in one hot)
-land slope
-land contour
-condition1 (proximity -> build map look at stuff / also neighborhood in AMES CITY)
-bldgType
-roofStyle
-ExterCond
-bsmtQual, bsmtCond needs to keep encoding order or one hot
- centralAir
- electrical
- BsmtHalfBarth
- kitchenAbvGr
- Functionality (also need to keep order if all categories should be kept)
- GarageQual, GarageCond
- MiscFeature
- SaleType
- SaleCondition

interesting stuff:
- overallQual (0-10)
- overallCond (0-10)
- calculate full SF area
- calculate price/SF (if possible)
- GarageYrBlt -> check if garage was build after house was built
-PAved Drive (duplicaet to alley?)
- moSold, YrSold (calc deltaTime since first sell)
- calculate overall porchSF
- overall house SF
- overall SF (garage, house, basement, porch)
- BsmtUnfSF into bool, do we have unfinished basement stuff / or finished into bool 
- !!! or calculate percentage finished / unfinished
- bool if remodeled 
- years after build the remodeled took place
